# Introduction to Python Data Analysis Project

🚀 Welcome to your journey in Python data analysis! In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of setting up a Python project in IntelliJ IDEA, creating a structured folder layout, and beginning our exploration of analyzing a CSV file obtained from Kaggle.

**Creating the Python Project**

📂 We started by creating a Python project named "onlineSaleDataCleansing" in IntelliJ IDEA.

**Setting Up Folder Structure**

📁 We established a well-organized folder structure to maintain our project's cleanliness and efficiency. This included directories for raw and processed data, notebooks for analysis, source code, tests, and documentation.

**Commands for Folder Creation**

🛠️ Utilizing the Command Prompt, we executed individual `mkdir` commands to create each directory in the desired project path.

```
mkdir D:\IdeaProjects\Python\onlineSaleDataCleansing\data\raw
mkdir D:\IdeaProjects\Python\onlineSaleDataCleansing\data\processed
mkdir D:\IdeaProjects\Python\onlineSaleDataCleansing\notebooks
mkdir D:\IdeaProjects\Python\onlineSaleDataCleansing\src\data
mkdir D:\IdeaProjects\Python\onlineSaleDataCleansing\src\models
mkdir D:\IdeaProjects\Python\onlineSaleDataCleansing\src\utils
mkdir D:\IdeaProjects\Python\onlineSaleDataCleansing\tests
mkdir D:\IdeaProjects\Python\onlineSaleDataCleansing\docs

```

Here's a brief description of each folder:

- **venv:** This is your virtual environment, which contains the Python interpreter and installed packages. It's typically created using a tool like `virtualenv` or `venv`.

- **data/raw:** This directory contains raw data files that you'll use in your analysis. These files are typically stored in formats like CSV, Excel, or JSON.

- **data/processed:** Once you clean and process your raw data, you can store the resulting datasets here. This ensures that you always have access to both the raw and processed versions of your data.

- **notebooks:** If you're using Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, you can store them in this directory. Notebooks are great for exploring data interactively and documenting your analysis.

- **src:** This is where your Python source code lives. It's organized into subdirectories based on functionality (e.g., data processing, models, utilities).

- **tests:** Unit tests for your code go here. Writing tests helps ensure that your code behaves as expected and makes it easier to catch bugs.

- **docs:** Documentation for your project, such as README.md or other project documentation files, can be stored here.

- **requirements.txt:** This file lists all the Python packages your project depends on, along with their versions. You can generate this file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing your project's dependencies.

**Exploring the CSV Dataset**

📊 Our dataset was sourced from Kaggle, a platform offering a wide array of datasets for analysis. We obtained a CSV file relevant to our project's scope.

**Initiating Data Analysis**

🔍 Our project aims to analyze data from an online sales dataset. We began by laying the foundation for data cleansing, manipulation, and exploration.

**Next Steps**

📝 With our project setup complete, we're ready to dive deeper into data analysis, including data cleansing, visualization, and statistical analysis.

**Key Takeaways**

- **Organization is Key:** A well-structured project layout enhances clarity and productivity.
- **Starting with the Basics:** Familiarize yourself with Python fundamentals before diving into data analysis.
- **Continuous Learning:** Embrace a learning mindset and don't hesitate to seek guidance when needed.
